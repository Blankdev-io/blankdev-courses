        <h2 class="mb-4">One-Product Store or General Store?</h2>

        <div class="courseimgcontainer"><img src="images/5.png" alt="shopify logo" class="courseimg"></div><br>

          <p>Unless you are a big company like Amazon or Walmart, it is probably not a good idea to try to sell everything and anything. Those companies are marketplaces where merchants generally compete on price. Dropshipping stores compete differently, usually in terms of brand image and value. <br></p>

          <p>What allows small businesses to compete with big conglomerates like Amazon is their focus on a single niche, or even on a single product, and their ability to cater to that market better than the competition. If you are in fitness, chances are your audience doesn't want to buy electronics from you, and vice versa. Instead, you can focus on becoming an authority in fitness accessories. Then customers may choose the value that your brand brings over that of big names like Amazon. <br></p>

          <p>It is usually recommended to start with a one-product store and as your profits increase, you can scale your eCommerce into a General Store.</p>

          <h2>One-Product Store</h2> 

          <p>A one-product store is a store that offers a single product, or a single product line. You may choose to still offer some extras or accessories related to the product, but the entire focus is on that product. <br></p>


          <p>While some people may think that this is a risky strategy, others will see that this is a fundamentally simpler option, especially if you have correctly done your market research and chosen a reliable supplier. <br></p>


          <p>A perfect example of a 1-product store is <a href="https://getsnooz.com">SNOOZ</a>. If you look at their website, you'll see that it is fairly simple. The home page is optimized to sell you on the <a href="https://getsnooz.com">SNOOZ</a>. It's not going to be the right product for everyone, but the people who are looking for a white noise machine will definitely remember the brand. <br></p>


          <h4>Advantages</h4>


          <ul>
            <li>One-product stores are able to apply all of their efforts on a single market or niche. This makes marketing much simpler.</li>
            <li>It is easier to convert a single product into a brand.</li>
            <li>One-Product stores are simpler. Since they offer fewer products than a general store, you will be dealing with one or a few suppliers.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Disadvantages</h4>

          <ul>
            <li>Choosing the wrong product.</li>
            <li>Insufficient market research can cause you to build an entire brand around a losing product.</li>
            <li>You might select a value proposition that isn’t aligned with what the consumers want.</li>
            <li>Greater reliance on suppliers. This can upset your business if your supplier is not reliable.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>General Stores</h2>


          <p>A general store is essentially a store that sells a bunch of different products usually across one or a few different niches. These niches are not always related, but it can help if they are. General stores usually have more elaborate websites with anywhere from a handful of products to several hundred. <br></p>


          <h4>Advantages</h4>


          <ul>
            <li>By offering a larger selection of products you are increasing the odds that the customer browsing your website will find one they like.</li>
            <li>Consumers enjoy having options available, as long as there aren't enough to lead to “choice paralysis”.</li>
            <li>You don’t rely on a single supplier.</li>
            <li>You can test several niches and products at the same time.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Disadvantages</h4>


          <ul>
            <li>General stores are less brandable than one-product stores.</li>
            <li>General stores have lower conversion rates than one-product stores.</li>
            <li>General stores have more competition than one-product stores. Rather than competing with sellers of a single product, you are suddenly competing with hundreds of other businesses.</li>
            <li>It is harder to market a collection of products than it is to market a single product.</li>
          </ul>
