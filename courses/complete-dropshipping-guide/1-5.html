        <h2 class="mb-4">Finding Suppliers</h2>

        <div class="courseimgcontainer"><img src="images/7.png" alt="shopify logo" class="courseimg"></div><br>

        <p>Once you’ve chosen what products to sell, you’ll need to figure out how you’re going to source them.</p>


			<h2>Search through online directories</h2>


			<p>Thanks to the internet, the perfect supplier might just be a few clicks away. There are plenty of online supplier directories that you can use to find potential vendors. Some of the most popular ones include: <br></p>


			<ul>
				<li>https://www.thomasnet.com</li>
				<li>https://www.alibaba.com</li>
				<li>http://www.globalsources.com</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Check out trade group websites</h2>


			<p>A good way to narrow down your supplier search is to check the website of trade organizations. Most of them have supplier directories that can help you zero in on potential vendors. For instance, the Personal Care Products Council, a trade association for those in the cosmetic and personal care products industry, has a handy search tool for personal care suppliers. Simply Google “[your product or industry] trade association” and you should be able to find relevant results. <br></p>


			<h2>Ask for referrals</h2>


			<p>Do you know anyone else in your industry? Ask them about the suppliers that they’ve worked with. It always helps to talk to someone with first-hand experience working with a vendor rather than doing your research entirely online. <br></p>


			<p>Pick up the phone or send an email to your industry contacts and tell them that you’re looking for vendors. And if you’re on LinkedIn, post an update or submit a discussion on relevant groups. You’re bound to come across someone who can point you in the right direction. <br></p>


			<h2>Vetting and Communicating with Suppliers</h2> <br>


			<p>Taking the steps above will help you create a shortlist of companies from which you can source your products or materials. From there, you need to evaluate potential vendors and determine who you’ll work with. <br></p>


			<p>Here’s how you can do that. <br></p>


			<p><b>Communicate with them</b> – Pay a visit, hop on a call, or send an email to potential vendors and get to know them better. Doing so will not only help you gather more information and get your questions answered, but it will also allow you to evaluate each supplier’s communication skills. This is key, especially if you’re dealing with suppliers overseas. The last thing you want is to miscommunicate or end up with the wrong products or orders. <br></p>


			<p>What exactly should you bring up when catching up with potential vendors? Here are some questions to start with: <br></p>


			<ul>
				<li>What are your payment terms? (It could be cash on delivery, net 30 days, net 90 days, etc.)</li>
				<li>What are your minimum order requirements?</li>
				<li>What would be the total costs? (In addition to the cost of products, you need to account for shipping costs, handling fees, etc.)</li>
				<li>Can you provide a certificate of liability insurance? (You need insurance in case of recalls, product malfunction, etc.)</li>
				<li>What happens if the orders don’t arrive? (You should know their policies around late or undelivered orders)</li>
			</ul>

			<p><b>Read reviews</b> – Even though speaking directly with suppliers is the best way to evaluate them, it will also help to read vendor reviews. Directories such as ThomasNet and Alibaba often have review sections, so browse their vendor profiles and see what other merchants are saying.</p>
