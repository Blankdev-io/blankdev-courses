        <h2 class="mb-4">eCommerce</h2>

			<div class="courseimgcontainer"><img src="images/1.png" alt="ecommerce" class="courseimg"></div><br>

			<p>Ecommerce is electronic commerce, a digital platform and a business model where you can buy or sell products online. Every time you purchase a product online, you’re participating in the ecommerce economy. <br></p>
			
			<p>The term is quite broad and it not only includes Amazon or eBay, but online banking, software services, remote service providers, or basically, any transaction made online. However, depending on the context, the term “ecommerce” is often used to refer to the typical online store that sells any product to end consumers. <br></p>
			
			<h2>Why is eCommerce so important?</h2>
			
			<p>The ability to make purchases online has changed our lives forever which basically means that eCommerce is here to stay. <br></p>
			
			<p>The eCommerce industry is growing each day, more eCommerce businesses are emerging as you read this, and the digital economy is continuously expanding while reaching every corner of the world that has internet access. <br></p>
			
			<h2>Which platform to use?</h2>
			
			<div class="courseimgcontainer"><img src="images/2.png" alt="shopify logo" class="courseimg"></div><br>
			
			<p>While the main marketplaces to start your eCommerce are Amazon and eBay, it’s highly recommended that you go with Shopify since it will be your personal store, you don’t have to pay any commissions to the big marketplaces, and you can truly be your own boss. <br></p>
			
			<p>If you decide to use Shopify for dropshipping, it has extremely useful apps to automate the dropshipping process. If you want your store setup with great looking templates, <a href="http://themes.blankdev.io">please check out our store!</a>. <br></p>
			
			<p>And while you can try several platforms at the same time, it is highly recommended that you focus on a single one when you start and then try to scale your business onto other platforms too. <br></p>
			
			<h2>How to be successful?</h2>
			
			<p>There’s no true or “easy” way to be successful when doing eCommerce, but there’s ways to increase your chances to be successful. <br></p>
			
			<p>The best recommendation when starting in this world is to study the competition, find successful small business owners and understand their products, their marketing strategies and even how they talk about their products or how they interact with customers. There's a lot more to selling products than just having something people want. <br></p>
			
			<p>Find products that customers want, make research on other online stores that sell them and try to implement their successful strategies on your own store. <br></p>
			
			<br><h2>Find a supplier</h2>
			
			<p>When you find a successful item that you want to sell in your eCommerce store, you have to find a direct supplier that will sell it to you at a cheaper price, especially wholesale. The best place to do this is with websites like <a href="http://Alibaba.com">Alibaba.com</a> or <a href="http://AliExpress.com">AliExpress.com</a> <br></p>
			
			<h2>What is Dropshipping?</h2>

			<div class="courseimgcontainer"><img src="images/3.png" alt="shopify logo" class="courseimg"></div><br>
			
			<p>Dropshipping is basically running a “stockless” shop, what does this mean? Well, you don’t have to buy products in advance, allocate space in storage for said products or have a bunch of unsold items taking up space. You accomplish this by buying directly from third parties like AliExpress and having those items delivered to your clients, in simpler terms, you’re a “middleman” between the actual store and the client. <br></p>
			
			<h2>Why Dropship?</h2>
			
			<p>The main reason why people decide to drophip is because you don’t need to invest a lot to start a business, you just need to find good products to sell, create an inviting online presence and cater to a niche you know you can sell to. You don’t need to commit to a single niche either, since you don’t have to buy products beforehand you won’t regret later about your $3,000 worth of unsold Fidget Spinners! Feel free to experiment, try different types of products until you find that sweet spot that gives you both a good amount of sales and profit margin. <br></p>
