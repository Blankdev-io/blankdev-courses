        <h2 class="mb-4">Mental models</h2>

		<div class="courseimgcontainer"><img src="images/46.png" class="courseimg"></div><br>

		<p>Over time, each person builds up a mental model of how the world works. These models are basic assumptions and processes we use to help us make decisions and complete tasks on a daily basis. These assumptions are not always 100 percent accurate, but are close enough to apply in most situations. <br></p>

		<p>For example, where would somebody find the tomatoes in a supermarket? It could be argued that they should be kept in the fruit aisle since, after all, they are a fruit. However, people expect to find them with the salad, because we use them in a salad. We have a mental model that establishes that expectation. <br></p>

		<p>The same is true online. Where would somebody find the shopping cart? The expectation is that it should appear in the top right corner. If it does not, we fail to reflect people’s mental model. <br></p>

		<p>As long as we understand these assumptions and conform to them, we can significantly reduce somebody’s cognitive load. However, to achieve that, we need to carry out user research to make sure we understand how they see the world. We will also need to complete usability testing to validate our proposed solution. <br></p>

		<p>It is easy to assume people share the same mental model, but that is rarely the case. For example, employees of a company will have a radically different mental model of their products from their customers, because their knowledge is more in-depth. In many cases, their understanding of their products has become intuitive. They do not need to think about it in a conscious way. <br></p>

		<p>The same is true for designers. Designers are experienced web users and have a more accurate mental model of web functions, patterns, and standards than most people. That often leads to designers making assumptions about the mental models held by others. <br></p>

		<p>For example, professional web designers are often shocked to find that many people type domain names into Google and then go to the first result, instead of accessing the domain directly from their address bar. To them, this seems like wasted effort, but it’s the process that some users are comfortable with. <br></p>

		<p>The concept of sticking with a method that works, despite its inefficiencies, also demonstrates the dangers of breaking a user’s mental model. <br></p>

		<p>For example, when a company redesigns their website or online store, they are often shocked at the negative backlash from users, despite the fact that the site is now considerably more efficient. This happens because the site now breaks the mental models people have built up around how to use their site. <br></p>

		<p>That is why so many people like using Amazon. It is not about whether it is easy to use or not—they like it because they know it. Amazon has never done a radical redesign. Instead, they have incrementally changed themselves over time, ensuring that they never break the user’s mental model of the site. <br></p>
